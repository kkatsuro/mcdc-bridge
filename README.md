# mcdc-bridge
Minecraft to Discord bridge and authorization Proof of Concept

This repository consist of:
* plugin for Redbot Discord (https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)
* 3 Minecraft PaperMC server plugins (https://github.com/PaperMC)

Server http is installed separately and doesn't do anything special - redbot copies http file to server's *verify/* subdirectory, and then waits for access message in the logfile.
